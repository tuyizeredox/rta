 * GET /api/account/card?side=front|back — the caller's own membership card.
 *
 * ONE SIDE PER REQUEST, ONE FILE PER SIDE. A card is printed in two passes,
 * and the person at the printer needs to hand over the front on one and the
 * back on the other. Returning both pages in a single PDF would make the
 * common case — print thirty fronts, then reload and print thirty backs —
 * fiddlier than it needs to be.
 *
 * No user id parameter, deliberately: the session decides whose card this is,
 * so there is nothing to tamper with and no ownership check to forget. Admins
 * printing on someone else's behalf go through the admin route instead, which
 * is scoped to their association and audited.
