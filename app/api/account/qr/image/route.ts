/**
 * GET /api/account/qr/image?format=png|svg — downloads the caller's own code.
 *
 * A route handler rather than a data: URL on the page, for two reasons. A
 * member on a cheap Android phone gets a real file in their Downloads folder
 * that they can attach, print at a kiosk or set as a lock screen; and the
 * secret stays server-side, never reaching the page's HTML where a screenshot
 * of the source or a copy of the cached document would carry it.
 *
 * PNG is the default because it is what every phone, printer and messaging app
 * understands. SVG is offered for printing: a vector card scales to a wallet
 * card or an A4 sheet without the soft edges that make a scanner hesitate.
