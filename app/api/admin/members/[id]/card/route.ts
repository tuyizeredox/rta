/**
 * GET /api/admin/members/[id]/card?side=front|back
 *
 * A member's card, printed by the office on their behalf. Most members here do
 * not own a printer, and plenty do not own a phone that can hold a PDF — the
 * association prints their card and hands it over, so the ability cannot live
 * only on the member's own login.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS AUDITED WHEN THE MEMBER'S OWN ROUTE IS NOT. The front embeds a
 * working sign-in credential. A member downloading their own is unremarkable;
 * a member of staff downloading someone else's is the same act as taking a
 * copy of their key, and the log is what makes that answerable afterwards.
