 * Root layout — the shell shared by every area of the platform.

 * The marketing Navbar and Footer used to live here. They moved down into
 * app/(public)/layout.tsx when the dashboards were added, because a signed-in
 * member looking at their savings balance should not be shown a "Become a
 * Member" call to action. The public pages themselves are unchanged and still
 * render exactly as before.
 *
 * Fonts, tokens and the language provider stay at this level so branding and
 * locale are consistent everywhere, dashboards included.
