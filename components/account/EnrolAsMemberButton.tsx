 * Opens a savings account for a member of staff, on their own login.
 *
 * The button is only rendered for someone the server has already established
 * is eligible — staff, in an association, with no member record, holding
 * `members.create`. That check is repeated in the route handler, which is what
 * actually decides; this is only about not showing a control that would fail.
 *
 * On success it refreshes rather than navigating: the same page then re-renders
 * with a balance, a membership number and a payment reference where the staff
 * panel used to be, which is the clearest possible confirmation that it worked.
