 * uses: with exactly two languages a menu costs an extra click to show one
 * option, and the current language is not visible until it is opened.
 *
 * Lives in ui/ rather than dashboard/ because the sign-in page needs it too —
 * a member who cannot read the sign-in page has no way to reach the Kinyarwanda
 * dashboard behind it.
 *
 * The choice is stored by the provider in a cookie and in localStorage, so it
 * survives a reload, follows the member between the public site and their
 * dashboard, and is visible to the server-rendered pages.
