/**
 * Status pill with a consistent colour language across the whole platform.
 *
 * The mapping is centralised so that "OVERDUE" is the same red everywhere it
 * appears — in a member's loan list, an admin's portfolio table and a report.
 * Inconsistent status colours are how people misread a financial screen.
 *
 * Colour is never the only signal: the label is always spelled out, which is
 * what carries the meaning for colour-blind users and in printed statements.
 *
 * A client component purely so it can reach the reader's language: the words
 * live in lib/i18n/dashboard/status.ts, and rendering an untranslated
 * "OVERDUE" beside an otherwise Kinyarwanda page is exactly the sentence a
 * member most needs to understand. It takes only serialisable props, so the
 * server components that render it in tables are unaffected.
