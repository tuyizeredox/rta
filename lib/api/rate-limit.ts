/**
 * Sliding-window rate limiter.
 *
 * SCOPE AND LIMITS: this is an in-process, in-memory counter. It is effective
 * against credential stuffing and scripted abuse against a single instance,
 * and it resets on restart. Running more than one app instance means each gets
 * its own budget, so the effective limit multiplies by the instance count —
 * move this to Redis before scaling horizontally.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT the only defence on login. Account-level lockout
 * (User.failedLoginAttempts / lockedUntil) is enforced in the database by the
 * auth service and survives both restarts and a rotating source IP, which is
 * what actually protects a specific member's account.
