 * are more likely to read English: an association officer in a district office
 * is not necessarily an English speaker, and an administrator who half-follows
 * an instruction is approving real money.
 *
 * Enum values — a member's status, a transaction type — are rendered by
 * StatusBadge from the database value and are not translated here; they are the
 * words the ledger itself uses, and two names for one state is how a
