/**
 * Dashboard translations.
 *
 * Kept apart from `dictionary.ts`, which covers the marketing site. The two
 * have almost no vocabulary in common — one sells membership, the other names
 * financial operations — and a single file carrying both would be edited by
 * different people for different reasons.
 *
 * Split by area rather than by language, so both languages of a phrase sit on
 * adjacent lines. A translator can then see what they are translating, and a
 * missing Kinyarwanda string is a type error rather than a screen that quietly
 * falls back to English.
 *
 * TRANSLATING FINANCIAL TERMS IS NOT A MATTER OF TASTE. A member reading
 * "Kubitsa" must understand the same operation an administrator sees as
 * "Deposit", because they are looking at the same ledger row from two sides.
 * Where an established Kinyarwanda banking term exists it is used; where one
 * does not, the English is kept rather than invented, since an unfamiliar
 * coinage is worse than a familiar loan word.
 *
 * Read from a client component with `useLanguage()`, and from a server
 * component with `getDashboardCopy()` in lib/i18n/server.ts — most dashboard
 * pages are server components, so that second path is the common one.
