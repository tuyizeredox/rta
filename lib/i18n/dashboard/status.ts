/**
 * Enum values as a person reads them.
 *
 * These are the words on every status pill in the platform, and they were the
 * last English left on an otherwise translated screen: a member could read the
 * whole of their savings page in Kinyarwanda and still be told their loan was
 * "OVERDUE" in a language they may not have.
 *
 * Keyed by the database enum rather than by screen, because the same value
 * appears in a member's loan list, an administrator's portfolio table and a
 * report, and all three must say the same word. StatusBadge is the only reader.
 *
 * ON AGREEMENT: Kinyarwanda inflects a verb to the class of its subject, and a
 * single badge is used for members, loans, payments and jobs alike, so no one
 * agreement can be correct everywhere. These use the impersonal class 8 "bi-"
 * form throughout — "Byemejwe", not "Yemejwe" — which is what the rest of the
 * dictionary already does for statuses shared across subjects, and which reads
 * as a statement about the record rather than about the person.
