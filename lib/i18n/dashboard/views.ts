/**
 * The shared components the dashboard pages are built from: filter bars,
 * pagination, the ledger and payment tables, charts and review queues.
 *
 * These are kept apart from the page dictionaries because one of them appears
 * on a dozen screens — the transaction table is the same table for a member,
 * an administrator and a super administrator — and duplicating its column
 * headings per page is how two screens end up disagreeing about what a column
 * means.
 *
 * Filter option labels are translated; their values are not. The value is the
 * database enum that reaches Prisma, so it stays in the URL and in the query
 * exactly as the schema spells it.
