 * component that queries the database — none of them can see localStorage, so
 * with localStorage alone the language switch could never reach the words a
 * page renders. A cookie travels with the request, so the server knows the
 * member's language before it renders a single row.
 *
 * localStorage is still written alongside it, because client components read
 * the choice synchronously through the provider without waiting for a render
 * pass, and because it is what the marketing site already used.
 *
 * Not HttpOnly and not signed: a language preference is not a credential, and
 * the client half of the app has to be able to write it.
