/**
 * Message templates.
 *
 * SMS BREVITY IS A COST DECISION, NOT A STYLE ONE. A segment is 160 GSM-7
 * characters, and every segment over that is billed again — for an association
 * sending repayment reminders to hundreds of members monthly, a sloppy
 * template doubles the bill. The SMS bodies below are written to fit one
 * segment, and they avoid characters that silently force UCS-2 encoding (which
 * would cut the limit to 70): no curly quotes, no en dashes, no emoji.
 *
 * Amounts always appear with their currency, and references are always quoted
 * in full — a member reading an SMS has no other context to work from.
