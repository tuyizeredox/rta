/**
 * WHAT A MEMBER MAY BORROW, AND WHAT IT WILL COST THEM.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT server-only, and deliberately pure. The same function runs
 * on the server, where it decides, and in the member's browser, where it shows
 * them the answer as they type an amount into the application form. One
 * implementation means the figure a member is shown before they apply is the
 * figure they are judged against when they do — a form that encourages
 * somebody to request 400,000 and is then refused by a server rule they never
 * saw is how people conclude the committee is playing favourites.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM `checkEligibility` IN THE LOAN CALCULATOR. That
 * function enforces the LOAN PRODUCT's limits — minimum amount, term bounds,
 * the savings multiplier the product was configured with. This one enforces
 * the ASSOCIATION'S OWN RULES, which apply to every product alike: how long
 * the association must have been running, how long you must have been saving,
 * the share of your own savings you may take without pledging anything, and
 * the fact that somebody behind on their daily contribution may not borrow at
 * all. Both run; a request has to satisfy the two.
 *
 * THE STRUCTURE OF THE ANSWER matters as much as the answer. A member turned
 * down is told which rule stopped them and what would change it — "you may
 * borrow 240,000 without collateral; above that you must pledge items worth
 * the difference" is actionable, and "not eligible" is not.
