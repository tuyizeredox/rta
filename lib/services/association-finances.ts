/**
 * THE ASSOCIATION'S BOOKS, WRITTEN FOR A MEMBER.
 *
 * Every other service here answers a question about one person. This one
 * answers the questions a member asks about the association itself: how much
 * do we have, what did we earn, what do we owe a bank, and what did the money
 * actually buy us. Until now those were answerable only from a treasurer's
 * notebook read aloud at a general meeting once a year.
 *
 * THREE RULES THIS MODULE HOLDS TO, because a transparency screen that
 * flatters is worse than no screen at all:
 *
 *  1. NOTHING IS ESTIMATED. Every figure below is a sum over posted ledger
 *     rows or over a value an administrator explicitly recorded and is
 *     accountable for in the audit log. There are no projections, no accruals
 *     of income not yet received, and no smoothing.
 *
 *  2. UNREALISED IS NOT INCOME. Interest a member owes but has not paid does
 *     not appear in the surplus — only `interestPortion` on repayment rows
 *     that actually settled does. An association that counted what it is owed
 *     as what it earned would show members a profit it cannot distribute.
 *
 *  3. WHAT IS NOT KNOWN IS NOT INVENTED. The association's cash at bank is not
 *     tracked by this platform, so it is not reported. What is reported is the
 *     residual implied by the books, labelled as such — and if that residual
 *     is negative, it is shown negative, because that means the records are
 *     incomplete and a member is better served knowing it than being shown a
 *     tidy zero.
 *
 * The member's own share is INDICATIVE and is labelled that way everywhere it
 * is rendered. A surplus becomes a member's money when the association resolves
 * to distribute it, not when this function divides it.
