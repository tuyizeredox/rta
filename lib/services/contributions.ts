/**
 * THE DAILY SAVING, AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY FALLS BEHIND.
 *
 * The rule is one line — save 1,000 a day plus 50 service fee, and a fine
 * follows seven missed days — and every hard decision in this module comes
 * from refusing to store that as a schedule.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO ROW PER DAY. The obvious design gives every member a row per
 * calendar day, marked paid or missed. It is wrong for the people this is
 * built for: a tailor does not pay 1,050 on Tuesday, they pay 7,350 on
 * Saturday when the market has been good, and a schedule of daily slots has to
 * be told how to spread that. Instead, TWO COUNTS ARE COMPARED:
 *
 *     days owed     = calendar days since the obligation began
 *     days covered  = total contributed ÷ the daily total
 *
 * Their difference is how far behind somebody is. Paying a week at once
 * advances the second count by seven and needs no special case; paying an odd
 * amount advances it by however many whole days that buys. Nothing has to be
 * reconciled overnight, no row can go missing, and the answer is the same
 * whether it is computed today or reconstructed from the ledger in five years.
 *
 * WHY ARREARS ARE NEVER CACHED. `days covered` is derived from the savings
 * ledger, which is the same append-only record every other figure in this
 * platform is derived from. A cached arrears column would be one more thing
 * that can silently disagree with the money — see rule 3 of the schema.
 *
 * WHY A FINE IS A DEBT AND NOT A DEBIT. Assessing a fine records what is owed
 * and tells the member. It does NOT reach into their savings. Two reasons: a
 * member with an empty balance would be driven negative by an automatic debit
 * for the crime of having no money, and an officer must have the chance to
 * waive a fine before it has already been taken. Collection is a separate,
 * deliberate act — `settleFine` — with its own audit entry.

/**
 * The calendar day of `date` in the association's own timezone, as a count of

 *
 * IN THE ASSOCIATION'S TIMEZONE, NOT THE SERVER'S. Kigali runs two hours ahead
 * of UTC, so a contribution paid at nine in the evening is tomorrow's in UTC.
 * Counting in UTC would tell a member who has paid every single day that they
 * are one day behind, which is precisely the accusation that destroys trust in
 * a system like this.
 *
 * Falls back to UTC if the association carries a timezone Node cannot resolve,
 * rather than throwing: a mistyped timezone must not take the dashboard down.

/**
 * Decides whether tonight's run owes this member a fine.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. The job runs every night, and a member who is
 * fourteen days behind must be fined twice in total — not once a night for a
 * fortnight, and not a second time the moment they pay a little without fully
 * catching up. Dates cannot answer that; a date-keyed fine gets reissued the
 * moment the arrears shift.
 *
 * THE RULE. A fine is triggered by the grace period, and each further fine
 * requires another full repeat period of missed days beyond the last one that
 * still bites. A prior fine "still bites" while the member has not yet covered
 * the days it punished — `dueDayIndex > coveredDays`. Once they have paid past
 * that point the fine drops out of the reckoning and the count starts again at
 * the plain grace period, which is what a member who caught up and later fell
 * behind again would expect.
 *
 * Worked through, with grace 7 and repeat 7:
 *
 *   covered 10, due 24 → 14 behind, nothing prior      → fine (threshold 7)
 *   covered 10, due 25 → 15 behind, prior at 14        → no fine (needs 21)
 *   covered 15, due 25 → 10 behind, prior still bites  → no fine (needs 21)
 *   covered 15, due 36 → 21 behind, prior still bites  → fine (threshold 21)
 *   covered 36, due 44 →  8 behind, no prior bites     → fine (threshold 7)
