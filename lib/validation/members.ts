/**
 * Admin member enrolment.
 *
 * Shared by the form and the route handler, so the browser and the server
 * apply the same rules. The client copy gives fast inline feedback; the server
 * copy is the one that decides.
 *
 * HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM SELF-REGISTRATION, AND WHY:
 *
 *   • No password. The member is not present to choose one, and an
 *     administrator choosing on their behalf means the administrator knows it.
 *     A temporary one is generated server-side and must be changed at first
 *     sign-in.
 *
 *   • Email is optional, phone is required. Self-registration happens on a
 *     web form, so the applicant necessarily has an email. A tailor enrolled
 *     at the desk frequently does not, and their phone is the identifier that
 *     actually reaches them — it is also a payment-matching key.
 *
 *   • Every field of the member file is accepted, not the handful the public
 *     form collects. The administrator is transcribing a paper application,
 *     and asking them to save a half-record and then edit it is how details
 *     get lost.
 */

/**
 * Optional free text: empty strings arrive from untouched form fields.
 *
 * The empty string is folded to undefined by a transform rather than by an
 * `.or(z.literal(""))` branch, because that branch is unreachable — "" is a
 * perfectly good string of no more than `max` characters, so the first arm of
 * the union always matches it and "" reaches the database as "". Every other
 * optional field in this file resolves to undefined when it is blank; a
 * cleared occupation has to do the same, or "not recorded" and "recorded as
 * nothing" become two different states that render differently.
