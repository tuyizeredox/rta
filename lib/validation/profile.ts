/**
 * Self-service profile editing — what a person may change about themselves.
 *
 * WHAT IS ABSENT, AND WHY. Everything omitted here is omitted because letting
 * someone edit it about themselves would route around a control:
 *
 *   • `status` and `kycStatus` — a member who could set their own status could
 *     lift their own suspension. Both move only through the admin actions that
 *     demand a permission and a reason.
 *
 *   • `memberNumber` and `paymentReference` — the member's identity, printed
 *     on every payment instruction they have been given. Editing a reference
 *     orphans the payments already matched by it.
 *
 *   • `note` — the audit note is the *actor's* justification to whoever reads
 *     the log later. Self-edits are recorded with the diff and nothing else; a
 *     reason a person writes about their own change is not a control.
 *
 * `nationalId` IS accepted here, but the service refuses to change one that
 * KYC has already verified — see lib/services/profile.ts. Recording a new one
 * puts identity back in the queue to be checked rather than trusting the
 * person who typed it.

/**
 * Name and contact, as the person themselves.
 *
 * These four are restated rather than picked out of `memberFieldsSchema`
 * because their messages are the difference between the two forms. The admin
 * schema says "Enter the member's first name" — correct at a desk, wrong on
 * the screen of the member reading it about themselves. Everything below this
 * point, where the rules are real work rather than a length check, is picked
 * from that schema so a rule exists in one place.
