/**
 * Edge middleware: routing and coarse role separation.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR: keeping people out of areas that are not theirs before a
 * page renders, without a database round trip on every navigation. It runs on
 * the Edge runtime, so it cannot reach Prisma and cannot know whether a session
 * was revoked or an account suspended since the token was issued.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT: the authorisation boundary. That lives in lib/auth/guards.ts
 * and runs in every page and route handler with the database as the authority.
 * If this file were deleted, the system would still be secure — just less
 * pleasant, because unauthorised users would reach a redirect one layer later.
 *
 * The public marketing site (/, /news, /register) is untouched by any of this.

 * balance like anyone else. What decides whether they see anything is
 * `requireMember` in the page, which asks whether the caller has a member
 * record of their own and sends them away if they do not. Role was never the
 * right question there; ownership is, and ownership needs the database.
