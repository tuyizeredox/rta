/**
 * Development-only demo data.
 *
 * Creates login-able accounts to develop against: one association admin and a
 * few members, each with an opened savings account.
 *
 * NOTE ON BALANCES: the accounts are created at zero. Balances are not written
 * directly here, ever — a balance that appears without a matching ledger row
 * is precisely the corruption this system is built to prevent, and a seed
 * script is not exempt from that rule. Demo money is posted afterwards through
 * the real ledger service (`npm run db:seed:transactions`), so the demo data
 * exercises the same code path production does.
 *
 * Guarded by SEED_DEMO=true and a non-production NODE_ENV in seed.ts.
