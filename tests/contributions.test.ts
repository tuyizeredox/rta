/**
 * THE RULES, PROVED.
 *
 * Everything tested here decides what a member owes or may borrow, and every
 * one of these figures ends up on a screen the member is expected to accept.
 * The parts worth proving are the ones where being slightly wrong is invisible
 * until somebody is charged for it:
 *
 *   • how a lump-sum payment turns into days covered — the whole arrears model
 *     rests on it, and getting it wrong accuses a paid-up member of arrears;
 *   • when a repeat fine is and is not due — the failure mode is fining
 *     somebody every night for a fortnight;
 *   • that the two halves of the interest sum back to the interest collected;
 *   • that the borrowing limit and its illustration agree with the rule as it
 *     was written down.
 *
 * The database is deliberately absent. Every function below is pure, which is
 * why it can be tested this way — and it is pure precisely so that it can be.
