/**
 * Background worker.
 *
 * A separate process from the web app, started with `npm run worker`.
 *
 * WHY SEPARATE: a Next.js server may be scaled to several instances, restarted
 * on deploy, or scaled to zero when idle. None of that is acceptable for the
 * job that credits members' payments. Running the scheduler in its own
 * single process means jobs fire exactly once, on a predictable clock,
 * regardless of web traffic.
 *
 * RUNNING MORE THAN ONE INSTANCE WOULD DOUBLE-RUN EVERY JOB. Set
 * WORKER_ENABLED=false on all but one node. Reconciliation is idempotent so a
 * duplicate run cannot double-credit, but repayment reminders are not — members
 * would receive every SMS twice, and pay for it in goodwill.
