 *   2. assess the fines the rulebook calls for;

 *
 * THE ORDER IS NOT ARBITRARY. Fees first, because charging them changes
 * balances but nobody's arrears. Fines next, judged on the arrears as they now
 * stand. Reminders last, so a member warned tonight is warned about their
 * position AFTER tonight's fine rather than the one before it — being told
 * "pay 6,300 to avoid a fine" by a system that fined you an hour earlier is
 * how people stop reading the messages.
 *
 * EVERY TASK IS IDEMPOTENT, guaranteed by unique indexes rather than by this
 * function being careful: (memberId, coveredThroughDay) on platform_fee_charges
 * and (memberId, dueDayIndex) on contribution_fines. A double-run, a retry
 * after a crash, or an officer pressing the manual button while this is
 * mid-flight all converge on the same state.
 *
 * One association failing does not stop the others. An association whose rules
 * are misconfigured must not cost every other tenant their nightly run.
